1. The form is for demonstration purposes - it doesn't actually submit data to a server
2. Date of birth is restricted between 1990-2010 (typical age range for undergrad applicants)
3. Bangladesh is pre-selected as the default country since USET is located there
4. GPA field accepts both scale out of 5.0 and percentage values
5. File upload accepts common formats (images for photo, PDF/DOC for transcripts)
